# BiteAndContourMapper---Phase1
This project demonstrates the power of data structures and algorithms by implementing a dynamic maze construction and navigation system in C++ using Qt. It is part of a course assignment designed to explore advanced concepts in data management, visualization, and navigation.

# Key Features
1. Bite and Contour Mapping:
Each "bite" is a uniquely identified point with a name and coordinates.
"Contours" represent height levels, forming hills or valleys with hierarchical relationships between parent and child contours.

2. Dynamic Relationships:
Bites are mapped to contours based on their coordinates and can navigate through hierarchical contour structures.
Sub-contours and parent contours are linked dynamically while maintaining constraints like height differences.

3. Data Management and Optimization:
Implements efficient data retrieval and manipulation functions with a focus on time complexity optimization (e.g., logarithmic or linear operations where possible).
Sorting and searching tasks leverage STL algorithms such as std::sort, std::unordered_map, and std::vector, ensuring scalability and performance.
Additional optimization techniques, including effective indexing and hashing, are used to minimize computational overhead.

4. Visualization:
Integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Qt to visualize bites, contours, and maze paths dynamically.

Technologies and Tools Used
Language: C++ (C++17)
Framework: Qt for GUI

This project is carried out under data structurs and algorithms module and I earned a Grade 5 (Excellent) for its comprehensive implementation and focus on efficient design. It serves as a practical demonstration of solving a complex problem by combining algorithmic thinking with effective data management, emphasizing the use of suitable data structures and optimizing for performance in various scenarios.
